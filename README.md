# ðŸ§ª Nanoparticle Segmentation and Defect Detection from SEM Images

This project focuses on detecting and measuring nanoparticles in SEM images  
using deep learning models (YOLOSeg, U-Net) and classical filters (DoG, NLM).  
In addition, we plan to extend the workflow to **defect and impurity detection**  
using **Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)** to distinguish  
particles from attached contaminants and foreign materials.

## ðŸ“‹ Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing** â€“ Flat-field correction, DoG, Non-local Means  
2. **Segmentation** â€“ YOLOSeg for nanoparticle extraction  
3. **Postprocessing** â€“ Contour analysis and particle sizing  
4. **Defect Detection (in progress)** â€“ R-CNN-based impurity and defect classification

## ðŸ§  Results
- Mean IoU: 0.73  
- AP: 0.82  
- Robust performance for < 500 nm particles  
- Ongoing development for adaptive impurity classification based on material type
